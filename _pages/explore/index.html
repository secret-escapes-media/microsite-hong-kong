This is certainly the cheaper side of Hong Kong shopping, where haggling is borderline mandatory, and a myriad of colourful trinkets line long market stalls.

Other highlights on the island include the Ngong Ping cable car, a superlative way of getting to and from the island, and the Wisdom Path, a truly spiritual experience that makes for great respite from the hustle and bustle of the city.
