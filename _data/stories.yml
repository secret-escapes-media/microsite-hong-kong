  location: Matala, Bay of Messara
  content: Matala in the Bay of Messara is full of history and true Cretan charm.  The caves in the cliff face were first hollowed out by the Romans and are well worth a wander round if only for the view.  Watch the sunset from the Lion Bar and enjoy traditional meze dishes all freshly prepared and the laid back atmosphere. Matala is also known for its hippy population, local artists and the Matala motto; Today is life, tomorrow never comes!

  location: Phaistos
  content: A must see is Phaistos – explore the vast palace and discover more about an ancient civilization. Try and crack the code of the Phaistos disk (my family and I think it is just a shopping list) and enjoy a Frappe in the cafe perched on the edge of the mountain overlooking the Messara Valley.

  location: Fiscardo, Kefalonia
  content: Fiscardo is found on the northern west of Kefalonia. Although the drive is a slightly lengthy 1hr30 minutes from the airport, the extra effort is worth it. It’s less crowded so more room on the beaches!
  name: George H

  location: Ithaca, Kefalonia
  content: Just opposite Fiscardo is the small island of Ithaca. It’s well worth the short boat ride as you pass some quite amazing coves (and often wildlife). Emma and myself signed up to a small snorkelling trip where they teach you about the sea life along the way.

Ride a donkey up to the Acropolis, walk around the alleys filled with shops or cool off at the beach in the warm, shallow waters before a quick jump off your boat on the journey home!

Plan it so you arrive at Oia just before sunset to get a good Caldera view.... reward yourself with a local beer for your hard work and you are set to go!

  location: Rhodes
  content: An absulute must if you are staying in Rhodes is a bay to bay boat trip. Plenty on offer from Rhodes town. We chose the love boat and had an excellent day. Visiting several bays including Kallithea, Faliraki, Afantou, and stopping for swimming breaks and a BBQ on the beach. Beautiful weather, views and crystal clear water guaranteed. A perfect day for an excellent price of just €45.
